	<h1>Auto Ellipsis with jQuery</h1>
	This script adds ellipses to text (...). It will automatically determine when text doesn't fit in its container; shortening the text and adding an ellispis.<br /><br />

	<h2>Known Issues</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This script does not add ellipsis dynamically, that is, once the script has run, any change in width of html elements will not adjust positioning of the ellipsis. You could call the script on a resize event however if the width is increasing in size there is no way (currently) for the script to be able to expand the text.</li>
		<li>Does not work on text with html (this includes entities)</li>
		<li>Doesn't respect padding</li>
	</ul>
	<hr />
	<h2>Changelog (v 1.1)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Added multi line support</li>
		<li>Removed some redundant code &amp; refactored</li>
		<li>Added minified - now only 1.26 kb</li>
	</ul>
	<hr />
	<h2>Todo</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>add persist</li>
		<li>add accuracy</li>
		<li>add support for html character entities</li>
		<li>improve multi line logic, to perhaps include some html such as paragraph tags or line breaks</li>
		<li>add custom ellipses / "read more" or allow the addition of a custom link/href attribute</li>
		<li>add "invert direction" on multi line in case text is often MUCH larger than the area it will fit in - performance enhancements</li>
	</ul>
